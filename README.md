# Data-Analysis-of-Lyft-Toledo-Ohio-Problem
You will find the detailed analysis that was conducted for the Lyft Toledo Ohio case proposal to find the appropriate pricing strategy to maximize profit over 12 months.



On this new launch, we're focusing on the route from the airport to downtown (in either direction, one way). The prevailing rate that people are used to paying on this route is $25. The prevailing wage that drivers are used to earning for this trip is $19. It turns out only 60 or si of every 100 rides requested are finding a driver at this price. 




Our goal is to maximize net revenue for the next 12 months on this route.
