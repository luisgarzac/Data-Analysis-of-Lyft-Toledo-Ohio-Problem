##**Data-Analysis-of-Lyft-Toledo-Ohio-Problem**

On this new launch, we're focusing on the route from the airport to downtown (in either direction, one way). The prevailing rate that people are used to paying on this route is 25 USD. The prevailing wage that drivers are used to earning for this trip is 19 USD. 
It turns out only 60 or si of every 100 rides requested are finding a driver at this price. 




### **Our goal is to maximize net revenue for the next 12 months on this route.**





> In this repository, you will find both the Excel file and the Python file with the detailed analysis of the problem and how the proposal was derived.
